Next Steps
Would you like to:

Start implementing the missing components one by one?
Focus on a specific feature area first (e.g., Document Management)?
Review the architecture decisions for any of these components?
Discuss how to handle any specific missing functionality?

Let me know which area you'd like to tackle first, and we can work through it step by step!
